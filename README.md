# CARLASec
This work aims to simulate automotive vehicle attacks using Controller Area Network (CAN) and Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) messages. 

It enhances the original CARLA simulator by incorporating a CAN bus, in-vehicle network, automotive protocols—specifically CAN and UDS—and safety analysis capabilities.
